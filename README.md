## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Discord account](https://discord.com/)
- [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-calendar-raid-helper.git
    cd google-calendar-raid-helper
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create Google API Credentials**:
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a new project if you donâ€™t have one.
    - Enable the Google Calendar API.
    - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (client ID and client secret).
        - When prompted for Application type use "Desktop App".
    - Obtain a refresh token.

4. **Obtain Refresh Token**:
    - After setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials, click on the authorization URL generated by the application in the console.
    - Go through the prompts and grant permission for the application to access your Google Calendar.
    - You will be redirected to a page with an authorization code in the URL bar.
    - Copy the authorization code from the URL parameter (e.g., `4/0AdLIrYcEDeEmjYPNgNyfbmV3uM0no697sKXkhpWDrSX1uztFCyBaT_erCA94UXdRBc1ulQ`).
        - Note that only part of this URL is copied. The part with `&scope=xxx` is not needed.
    - Paste the authorization code into the terminal/console when prompted by the application.
    - The application will exchange the authorization code for a refresh token automatically.
    - Save the `refresh_token` provided in the terminal/console output.
    - Paste the value of `refresh_token` into the `.env` file under the `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` variable.

    **Note**: We didn't use tools like Postman or cURL for this process. The authorization flow was handled directly by the application.
    When configuring OAuth 2.0 credentials with Google and Discord, ensure to set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/oauth2/callback`. This URI is used for the authorization callback and must match the redirect URI specified in your OAuth 2.0 credentials settings. It allows the application to securely receive authorization codes and tokens after the user grants permission.

5. **Create and Populate Configuration Files**:
    - Create a `config.json` file containing non-sensitive information such as time zone and calendar ID:

        ```json
        {
        "calendar": {
            "timezone": "America/New_York",
            "calendarId": "primary"
        }
        ```

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Discord bot token and Google API credentials:

        ```plaintext
        DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
        GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=your_google_redirect_uri
        GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_refresh_token
        ```

6. **Run the Bot**:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Configuration

- **Google API Credentials**: Follow the steps in the [Installation](#installation) section to obtain these credentials and populate the `.env` file.
- **Discord Bot Token**: Create a Discord bot, invite it to your server, and get the token. Populate the `.env` file with this token.

## Usage

- **Add Event Command**:
  - Use the `!addevent <eventID>` command in your Discord server to fetch event details from Raidhelper and add them to Google Calendar.
  - Example:
        `!addevent 1234567890`

## Project Structures
